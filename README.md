# 👋 Welcome

I'm a cybersecurity student focused on building practical security tools and learning through hands-on experimentation.  
Currently developing **ParaScan** — an advanced internal reconnaissance framework for stealthy port mapping, host impersonation, and traffic simulation.

---

## 🔧 Projects

Advanced LAN port scanner with:

- TCP conversation emulation
- IP/MAC spoofing
- Entropy-based traffic shaping
- Passive response analysis
- DNS/DHCP injection modules (planned)

Built to simulate realistic attacker behavior and support defensive detection research.

---

## 🧠 Learning Areas

- Raw socket programming (Python)
- Traffic fingerprinting (TTL, window size, flags)
- Detection evasion strategies
- Red team behavior modeling
- Blue team detection mapping

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Secure a cybersecurity role in SOC, IR, or threat intel
- Build a strong foundation for ethical exploit and malware development
- Contribute tools that help defenders understand real-world attack patterns
